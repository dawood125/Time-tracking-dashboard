# Frontend Mentor - Time Tracking Dashboard



## üöÄ Overview

This is my solution to the [Time Tracking Dashboard challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/time-tracking-dashboard-UIQ7167Jw) on Frontend Mentor. The goal was to build a responsive dashboard that displays time spent on various activities, with the ability to switch between daily, weekly, and monthly views.

## üéØ Features

- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop
- Switch between Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats
- Hover states for interactive elements
- Data loaded dynamically from `data.json`
- Clean, semantic HTML and modern CSS

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Custom Properties)
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Bootstrap 5
- [Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik) font

## üìö What I Learned

- How to structure a dashboard UI with semantic HTML and CSS Grid/Flexbox
- Dynamically updating UI based on user interaction using JavaScript
- Handling JSON data and updating DOM elements efficiently
- Responsive design techniques for different screen sizes
- Improving accessibility and user experience with focus/hover states

### Example: Dynamic UI Update

```js
// Update activity cards based on selected timeframe
function updateUI(data, filter) {
  const filterLabels = { daily: "Yesterday", weekly: "Last Week", monthly: "Last Month" };
  data.forEach((activity, index) => {
    const card = document.querySelectorAll(".activity-content")[index];
    card.querySelector(".current-hours").textContent = `${activity.timeframes[filter].current}hrs`;
    card.querySelector(".previous-hours").textContent =
      `${filterLabels[filter]} - ${activity.timeframes[filter].previous}hrs`;
  });
}
```

## üîÑ Continued Development

- Add animations for smoother transitions between timeframes
- Improve accessibility (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation)
- Refactor JavaScript for better scalability
- Add unit tests for UI logic
